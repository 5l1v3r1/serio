# serio

Allows uploading of binary files from a host PC to an embedded Linux system via the embedded system's serial port or telnet connection without any special binaries on the embedded system.

The only requirements on the embedded system is that it provides an interactive shell on the serial port, and that the shell's echo command supports the -n and -e options.
